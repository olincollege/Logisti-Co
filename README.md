# Logisti-Co.

Tower defense game focused on logistical management.

This is a tower defense game, similar to other games of this genre (Bloons Tower Defense or Plants vs. Zombies). Our setting is a factory which produces packages needing to be packed - your job is to create a robotic system which does this. Manage your economy and your robot placement to optimally deal with an increasing stream of packages without unpacked boxes from reaching the end of the path. See how long you can last!
